## Motivation

React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution. It replaces and improves upon several navigation libraries in the ecosystem, including Ex-Navigation, React Native's Navigator and NavigationExperimental components. React Navigation can also be used across React and React Native projects allowing for a higher degree of shared code.

Once stable, NavigationExperimental will be deprecated in favor of React Navigation. React Navigation is a collaboration between people from Facebook, Exponent and the React community at large.

## [Getting started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/intro/)

1. Create a new React Native App

```
react-native init SimpleApp
cd SimpleApp

```

1. Install the latest version of react-navigation from npm

```
yarn add react-navigation

```

or

```
npm install --save react-navigation

```

1. Run the new app

```
react-native run-android # or:
react-native run-ios

```

## Community

We have an active channel on the [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/) community. It's the best place to show off things you've made with the library, ask for help, or just hang out and discuss the project. This also helps keep the [issues](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues) manageable.
